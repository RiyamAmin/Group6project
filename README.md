We chose this dataset to work on and mine it since lung cancer is the leading case of cancer death worldwide, one of the main reasons for lung cancer is smoking, but exposure to air pollution can increase the risk for having a lung cancer even for non smokers to, we will analyze this data to study the effect of air pollution to the people who lived with high levels of air pollution and those who lived in areas with low levels of air pollution to enable us to know the main reasons of lung cancer, improving the living situation of the people who live in high air pollution, providing the assistance required to reduce lung cancer and provide early detection to them.
